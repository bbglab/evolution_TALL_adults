In the code, there are paths pointing to this folder used in the fitting of signatures. The files used can be found here:

From COSMIC https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures we downloaded the latest version of Single Base Substitution (SBS) Signatures and 
created a dataframe called signatures.pcawg with the 96 channels as columns and the signatures as rows.   

We added to the above COSMIC signatures, the signature of HSCP extracted from the data of Osorio et al., 2018 PMID: 30485801 and created the dataframe signatures_added.pcawg

We added to the above COSMIC signatures, the treatment-related signatures A and B reported in the supplementary materials of Li et al., 2020 PMID: 31697823 and created the dataframe leukemia_signatures.pcawg
